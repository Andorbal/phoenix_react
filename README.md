# PhoenixReact

This is a crazy simple Phoenix application that's for learning React and how it can interact with an API.

The code in here may be considered great or terrible; since I'm new to React and still relatively green with
Elixir, I'm just playing around.  You've been warned.

And if you care, I'm going to attach the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) to it.  Why the heck not?
